# PySide Skeleton App

A Skeleton project for creating PySide applications that can be built into executables and installers using [cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

There are two main files to look at when customzing: [__init__.py](/app/__init__.py) and [setup.py](/setup.py). In __init__.py the APP_NAME, ORGANIZATION_NAME, and DOMAIN_NAME should all be updated with appropriate values. In setup.py the description and author should be updated.
